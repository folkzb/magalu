Asynchronously delete a Snapshot for the currently authenticated tenant.

#### Rules
- The Snapshot's status must be "completed".
- The Snapshot's state must be "available".
- Deleting a Snapshot that has been restored is not possible. If necessary,
 delete the restored Volume first and then proceed to delete the Snapshot.

#### Notes
- Utilize the **block-storage snapshots** list command to retrieve a list of
 all Snapshots and obtain the ID of the Snapshot you wish to delete.
- If needed, you can use the **block-storage volume list** command to retrieve
 a list of all Volumes and obtain the ID of the restored Volume.
